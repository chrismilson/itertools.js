# `itertools.js`

The python language (both python core and the `itertools` module) have great
support for dealing with iterators and iterables. Sometimes the same
functionality would be nice to have in javascript and typescript.

This package implements some of the useful iterator-related functions in
typescript, so that you can get the same great readability as a python program,
all while keeping that juicy compile-time type safety.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @shlappas/itertools
```
